## Introduction
This is the code repository for the 10th IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMMUNICATIONS AND ELECTRONICS 2024 (IEEE ICCE 2024) paper ["Expanding Vision in
Tree Counting: Novel Ground Truth Generation and Deep Learning Model"](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10634677) 

In our paper, we propose two contributions:
- A new ground truth generation practice to potentially boost the training effectiveness.
- A new tree-counting model called TreeVision with competitive performance compared with state-of-the-arts.

## Project structure

## Environment setup
We develop our project on Google Colab platform with Python 3.10.

To set up the environment, please:
 
 1. Clone this repository
 2. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
